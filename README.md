# Accessibility Theme Patterns for WordPress

Hello! The Accessibility Theme Patterns for WordPress helps you create accessibility-ready WordPress themes. The code isn't meant to be a complete theme, but each pattern in the sub-directories can help you make your theme more accessible.

## Getting Started

Here are some helpful tips to get you rolling with the patterns:

* Each pattern is contained in a sub-directory in this repository.
* Many of the patterns include placeholder text for function names or text domains, like `your_theme_function_name`. Make sure you replace these.
* Each pattern should have its own README.md file to help guide you.
