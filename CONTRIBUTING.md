# Contributing to Accessibility Theme Patterns for WordPress

Thanks for contributing to Accessibility Theme Patterns for WordPress. The Web is more accessible because of you!

Before getting started, make sure your possible new pattern or issue has not been discussed earlier. You can [search for existing tickets here](https://github.com/wpaccessibility/a11ythemepatterns/search).

## New Patterns

1. Check the existing issues to make sure no one else is already working on a similar pattern.
2. Make an issue, suggesting the new pattern, why you think it's needed, and, if possible, a link to it on the Web.
3. Next, make a pull request. We use the [fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/#types-of-collaborative-development-models).

## Bug Reports

Here are some tips to consider and to help you write a great report:

* Accessibility Theme Patterns supports Internet Explorer 9 and greater, as well as the latest two versions of all other major browsers.
* Accessibility Theme Patterns is backwards compatible with the two versions prior to the current stable version of WordPress.
* Accessibility Theme Patterns uses HTML5 markup.
* Currently, Accessibility Theme Patterns does not include build tools or preprocessors to keep things simple. This may change in the future.
